1. Build the docker image

./build-armoury-docker

2. Start the container

./run-armoury-docker

3. Attach additional shell sessions to the container

./armoury-docker-shell

The workspace/ directory is shared between the host and the container. Refer the file workspace/KERNEL_COMPILE.TXT for an example on how to cross compile a really old Linux kernel for the ARM/MIPS/MIPSEL architecture.
